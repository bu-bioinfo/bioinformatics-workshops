    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a commonly used technique to create linearly uncorrelated features from a set of possibly correlated features. The procedure is done in such a way that the first feature produced by PCA, the first principal component – PC1, explains the largest amount of variability possible. In this way, PCA is a dimension reduction technique, as the first few principal components often explain upwards of 90% of the variability found within a dataset. It is important to note that if we’re planning on predicting anything using the principal components, such as tissue type or Disease.status, those features should not be included in the input matrix. Before performing PCA, create a new data frame containing only explanatory values (i.e. the features we want to use to predict class membership).\n",

    "Supervised learning is a technique to teach an algorithm to distinguish between previously labelled groups, such as Tissue, Gender, or Disease.status. However, all supervised methods require data to learn how to differentiate between classes. Therefore, it is necessary to separate data into test/train sets. The training set is used to train the model, while the test set is used to evaluate performance. Cross-validation, a method of partitioning the data into disjoint subsets and continually re-training and re-testing with different partition combinations, is often used to evaluate models. In this section, we will build various classifiers using logistic regression to predict different classes from our data. You should evaluate your models’ performances using confusion matrices and accuracy scores."
